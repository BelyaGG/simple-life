                <p class="about-des">
                    <b>I used to be a pack rat.</b>  I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
                    any of it because there was too much.<br><br> 
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, 
                    and I couldn't hold a relationship. <br><br>
                    <span>I turned things around</span> <br> 
                    <b>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</b> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, 
                    sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. <br><br> 
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. <br>
                    <span>Now I live the simple life </span> <br>
                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. <br><br> 
                    With how much it turned my life around, 
                    <b>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</b>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
